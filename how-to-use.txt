How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.



The instructions are:

1. Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
2. UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
3. Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
4. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
5. Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
6. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
7. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
8. Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
9. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
10. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
